# This is the config file for a class S theory of A_2 type
# one a sphere with three punctures. 
# It's a theory of 9 free hypers, described in the spectral 
# networks paper by GMN, section 8.3.
# At -1, 1 we have punctures of types [1,1,1]
# while at 0 we have a puncture of type [2,1]
# The residues are for the former
# phi = (dz / z) diag(m_i, M_i , -m_i -M_i)
# for i=1,2; While it's
# phi = (dz / z) diag(m, m, -2m)
# for the latter.
